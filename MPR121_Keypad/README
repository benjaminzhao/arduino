 Turns the MPR121 Touchpad into a phone keypad. Pressing a pad will
 print a 0-9, * or #.
 
 Hardware: 3.3V Arduino UNO R3
           SDA -> A4
           SCL -> A5
           IRQ -> 4
           
 I wasn't having any luck using the Wire.h library, so I've adapted
 I2C code from an ATmega328 library to get this working.
 If you can get this working with the Wire.h library, I'd be thrilled to hear!
